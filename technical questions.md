#1.	How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
Answer:	I spent about 8 hours to complete the test. I would have added an Admin panel to control the UI and the Data on the website independently for the Website, without changing in the code.

#2.	How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
Answer:	I generally look into detail of the issue by first checking if it is specifically a data issue(if it is specific to particular set of data) or a bug, accordingly I look into the components of the application and try to replicate and solve the issue in lower environments and do a quick sanity test on all other related functionalities that might be affected with the changes, with review of testers and peers I will push that fix to higher environments.

#3.	Please describe yourself using JSON.
